The /mediawiki.d/ sub directory contains PHP files that are injected by Quibble
in MediaWiki LocalSettings.php

To be recognized properly, a setting file must start with two digits and end
with '.php'. Additionally, the PHP files MUST start with a PHP open tag '<?php'
and MUST NOT use a PHP closing tag '?>'. If any of the two conditions is not
met, the file will be ignored.

Quibble would run /mediawiki.d/_join.php which reads and concatenate the files
per their alphabetical order and injects the result at the end of
LocalSettings.php.
